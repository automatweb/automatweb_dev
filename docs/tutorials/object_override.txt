tegin storagele sellise v6imaluse, et saab extendida objektiklasse osade
objektityypide jaoks.

+ new option for storage - now you can extend the object class for
specific classes with your own and override stuff like that, instead of
messages. for instance, setting the password property on the cl_user
object should encrypt it with md5, if it is so set in the ini file.
currently you have to do that every time you call the set_prop yourself.
now there is a way to make that happen automatically. like this:

in the classes[] ini entry you say this:
classes[197][object_override] = core/users/user_object

and in the file you do this:
<?php

class user_object extends _int_object
{
        function set_prop($k, $v)
        {
                if ($prop == "password")
                {
                        if (aw_ini_get("auth.md5_passwords") == 1)
                        {
                                $v = md5($v);
                        }
                }
                parent::set_prop($k,$v);
        }
}
?>


and that's it. basically, you say in the ini file that ou want to
override the object class for 
this class and specify the file in which the override resides. the
override must be derived from _int_object and then you can override any
function in the _int_object class that you want. public methods only, of
course. 

and now, whenver a CL_USER object is loaded by storage, your class is
loaded instead.
