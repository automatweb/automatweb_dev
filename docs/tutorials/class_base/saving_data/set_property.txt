set_property

will be called once for each property when the form is saved

<b>Example 5.1. Reference implementation</b>
#php#
function set_property($arr)
{
	$data = &$arr["prop"];
	$retval = PROP_OK;
	switch($data["name"])
	{
		case "name":
			do_something_fancy($data);
			break;

		case "comment":
			if (!correct_value($data["value"]))
			{
				$retval = PROP_ERROR;
				$data["error"] = "This value is not in the correct format";
			};
			break;
	}
	return $retval;
}

Arguments passed to set_property

<b>obj_inst</b>
    Pointer to the loaded object. If a new object was created then at this point it already exists in the memory, so you can do your usual set_prop,etc calls on it.

<b>request</b>
    Array containing the arguments to the script. Use this instead of $_POST superglobal.

<b>prop</b>
    Array containing infromation about the current property, this mean all attributes in the property definition. The "value" field contains the value that was entered in the form.

<b>new</b>
    Set to 1, if this is a new object.

<b>Important</b>
If you do not return PROP_OK from your set_property method, then the value of this property will not be saved.

<b>Important</b>
Do not assume that set_property calls will arrive in a certain order, they almost certainly will not.
