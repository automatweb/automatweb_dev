The scheduler can be used to schedule events to happen at certain times.
An event is an orb function call that will get called at the time specified. 
You can specify a certain time or an aw repeater when the event will take place.

The fields in the event array are:
time - the time that the event is scheduled for - unix timestamp
event - the full url of the page that will be requested
uid - the username as who the event will be executed
password - the password for the account in uid
rep_id - the id of the repeater that generated this event
 
The fields in the log entry array are:
time - the time that the event was actually executed
event - the event array for the event that took place
response - the text that was returned from the HTTP request including headers
