aw_array is a class provided by the AutomatWeb base system and that simplifies php's array management.

Description:

The class is defined in the base class framework, so it is always available and therefore you cannot use get_instance to instance it, but must use 

$inst = new aw_array();

The class is meant to make array handling a bit easier and to avoid statements like

if (is_array($arr))
// do_something


The constructor, can initialize the class with an array

arguments:

$arr - optional 
if this argument is specified, it is assumed to be a php array that the aw_array object will contain

example:

$arr = new aw_array($arr["request"]["some_array"]);
foreach($arr->get() as $key => $value)
{
...
}
