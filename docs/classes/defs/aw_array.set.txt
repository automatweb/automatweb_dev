<b>aw_array::set($val)</b>

adds the value of $val to the end of the array (does what the php expression $arr[] = $val would do if $arr was a regular php array)

Example:

$tmpmatch = new aw_array();
$this->db_query("SELECT DISTINCT(objects.oid) AS oid FROM objects WHERE $wis ");
while($match = $this->db_next())
{
 $tmpmatch->set($match["oid"]);
};
