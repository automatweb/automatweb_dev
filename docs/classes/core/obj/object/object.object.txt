The object class represents a single object and has member functions via which you can modify or query all aspects of the object, also save it, copy it and delete it.


<b>Constructor</b>

the constructor can be called in four different ways:
- without parameters: creates empty object
- single integer: loads the object
- single textual parameter: assumes the parameter is object alias, finds the object and loads it

in addition to the constructor, there is an utility function obj() in the global scope, to lessen the need to type, that passes it's parameters to the constructor

<b>Errors</b>

- if the user has no access to the object, acl error is thrown
- if no such object exists or it cannot be loaded, error is thrown

<b>Returns</b>

constructors have no return value

<b>Examples</b>
#php#
$o = new object; // creates an empty object

$o = obj(666);	  // loads object with id 666

// finds object that has alias osakonnad/majandus and loads it
$o = obj("osakonnad/majandus");		
$o = new object(array(
   "name" => $name, 
   "parent" => $parent,
   "class_id" => CL_FOO
));#/php#
