The advantages of the new storage system are mainly that it supports reading writing all properties of an object, not just the object table fields and that it completely virtualizes object access. Basically, the idea is that user code does not contain sql queries, instead all objects are acessed through this interface, therefore providing a single point where we can add features, like object caching, object remoting, brother support and languages support.

The properties for different types of objects are defined in class files, the property definition description can be found under the class_base documentation section.

<b>This spec defines 4 new classes</b>

<ul><li>object
This class represents a single object and has member functions via which you can modify or query all aspects of the object, also save it, copy id and delete it.

<li>connection
this class abstracts the current alias system

<li>object_list
with this class you can combine objects into lists and perform operations on several objects at once. basically, this is the replacement for sql search queries.

<li>object_tree
with this class you can manage object trees, this is the basis for automatweb's object filesystem, it presents the datbase as an abstract tree.</ul>
