object_list class - with this you can manage object lists

In addition to the member functions described here, this class also implements all the  object class mutator functions, only in this case they apply fot all objects in the list, for instance #php# $ol->set_name("fish"); #/php# will change all the objects names in the list to "fish". You must also call $ol->save() to save the objects, because they are not saved automatically

<b>constructor:</b>

<b>errors:</b>
constructors return no errors

<b>parameters:</b>
- array of filter parameters, by what the object list is filtered. if class is 
specified in the filter, the filter can also include properties, otherwise properties 
are ignored, only object table parameters are used, optional
  type: array

<b>returns:</b>
none

<b>examples:</b>
#php#
$ol = new object_list;

$ol2 = new object_list(array(
	"name" => "%foo%",
	"class_id" => CL_BAR,
	"cool_property" => true
));

// it is possible to add sorting rules to object_list parameters
// they should be "table_name.field_name ASC|DESC"

// limit is used as in mysql queries, so refer to mysql manual how this should be used

$ol3 = new object_list(array(
	"name" => "%foo%",
	"class_id" => CL_BAR,
	"sort_by" => "objects.created DESC",
	"limit" => "2,6" 
));
