in addition to the member functions described here, this class also implements all the object class mutator functions, only in this case they apply for all objects in the tree, for instance #php# $ot->set_name("fish"); #/php# will change all the objects names in the tree to "fish". you must also call #php# $ot->save() #/php# to save the objects, because they are not saved automatically
