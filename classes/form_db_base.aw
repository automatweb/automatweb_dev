// ok. what is this, you ask?
//
// well, lemme tell ya a story:
//
// once upon a time in a software not so far away, there was this component called FormGen
// and this component could create and mantain database tables of it's own kind nicely
// but it severely lacked an interface through which it could easily and transparently
// use database tables created not by itself, but by the strange people from the worlds beyond the computer screen.
// after some pondering there was a loud TWANG! and lo and behold - a class by the name of form_db_base was created
// to magically swipe away all the worries of the FormGen.
// it had functions to read and write data - to query the deeply mythical structures of the Database Tables - and even
// modify them, so great was it's power!
// so it fulfilled the void in the heart of FormGen and is still happily doing it until today.
//
// right. a simple rule - all functions in this class MUST be wrapped in save_handle() / restore_handle() calls so
// that they will not interfere with their callers - even if it's pretty freaking obvious they do something with
// the database.
//   
// everything here assumes that the form is already loaded - having to load the form would be too high level
// for this class - it's here to handle the dirty little details and not used from outside formgen - that's also
// the reason why we should look lightly at calling functions defined on classes derived from this 
//
